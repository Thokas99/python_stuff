Hey there! So, I created this super cool repository on GitHub where I'm basically dumping all of the scripts that I'm writing as part of my Computational Biology classesBut don't worry, it's not as boring as it sounds! Think of it like a treasure trove of code gems that I'm discovering on my journey to becoming a bioinformatics master.
